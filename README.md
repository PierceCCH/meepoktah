# Official website for UCLA SSA

Hello! This repository contains the code for the website of the [UCLA Singapore Students' Association](www.uclassa.org).

The website fetches content from a MongoDB database via an Express.js backend.

Images are hosted on the SSA Google Drive, with embed code generated using [this tool](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embedding-google-photos-image).

Styling was mostly achieved using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

### Development setup
```
git clone https://github.com/PierceCCH/meepoktah
