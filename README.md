# Official website for UCLA SSA

Hello! This repository contains the code for the website of the [UCLA Singapore Students' Association](www.uclassa.org).

The website fetches content from a MongoDB database via an Express.js backend.

Images are hosted on the SSA Google Drive using sharable links.

Styling was mostly achieved using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
